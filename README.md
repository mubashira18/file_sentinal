# Real-Time File Monitoring and Notification System

## Overview
This project is a real-time file monitoring and notification system designed to improve web-based file management. It enables users to monitor changes in a specified directory in real-time, including file additions, modifications, and deletions. The system uses WebSocket communication for instant updates and integrates with MongoDB for efficient data storage and retrieval.

## Features
- Real-time file monitoring using Chokidar
- Instant notifications via WebSocket communication
- Integration with MongoDB for data storage
- User registration and login system
- Email notifications using Nodemailer
- User-friendly interface built with React

## Tech Stack
- **Node.js**: Backend server runtime environment
- **Express.js**: Web application framework for Node.js
- **Chokidar**: Efficient file watching library
- **WebSocket**: Real-time communication protocol
- **MongoDB**: NoSQL database for data storage
- **Nodemailer**: Email sending library for Node.js
- **React**: Frontend library for building user interfaces

## Prerequisites
- Node.js (v12.x or higher)
- MongoDB (v4.x or higher)
- npm (Node package manager)

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/repo-name.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd repo-name
   ```
3. Install the dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
4. Set up environment variables by creating a `.env` file in the root directory:
   ```env
   PORT=3000
   MONGODB_URI=your_mongodb_uri
   JWT_SECRET=your_jwt_secret
   SMTP_HOST=your_smtp_host
   SMTP_PORT=your_smtp_port
   SMTP_USER=your_smtp_user
   SMTP_PASS=your_smtp_password
   ```

## Usage
1. Start the backend server:
   ```bash
   npm run server
   ```
2. Start the frontend development server:
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```
3. Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:3000`.

## Project Structure
- `backend/`: Contains the Express server and backend logic
- `frontend/`: Contains the React application
- `models/`: MongoDB models
- `routes/`: API routes
- `controllers/`: Request handlers
- `middlewares/`: Custom middleware functions

## Key Components
### Chokidar
Chokidar is used to watch for file changes in the specified directory. It triggers events when files are added, modified, or deleted.

#### Example
```javascript
const chokidar = require('chokidar');
const watcher = chokidar.watch('./path/to/dir', {
  ignored: /(^|[\/\\])\../,
  persistent: true
});

watcher
  .on('add', path => console.log(`File ${path} has been added`))
  .on('change', path => console.log(`File ${path} has been changed`))
  .on('unlink', path => console.log(`File ${path} has been removed`));
```

### Nodemailer
Nodemailer is used to send email notifications to users.

#### Example
```javascript
const nodemailer = require('nodemailer');

let transporter = nodemailer.createTransport({
  host: process.env.SMTP_HOST,
  port: process.env.SMTP_PORT,
  secure: false, // true for 465, false for other ports
  auth: {
    user: process.env.SMTP_USER,
    pass: process.env.SMTP_PASS
  }
});

let mailOptions = {
  from: '"Your Name" <your-email@example.com>',
  to: 'user@example.com',
  subject: 'File Notification',
  text: 'A file has been changed in your monitored directory.'
};

transporter.sendMail(mailOptions, (error, info) => {
  if (error) {
    return console.log(error);
  }
  console.log('Message sent: %s', info.messageId);
});
```
