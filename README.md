# Real-Time File Monitoring and Notification System




## Overview
This project is a real-time file monitoring and notification system designed to improve web-based file management. It enables users to monitor changes in a specified directory in real-time, including file additions, modifications, and deletions. The system uses WebSocket communication for instant updates and integrates with MongoDB for efficient data storage and retrieval.

## Features
- Real-time file monitoring using Chokidar
- Instant notifications via WebSocket communication
- Integration with MongoDB for data storage
- User registration and login system
- Email notifications using Nodemailer
- User-friendly interface built with React

## Tech Stack
- **Node.js**: Backend server runtime environment
- **Express.js**: Web application framework for Node.js
- **Chokidar**: Efficient file watching library
- **WebSocket**: Real-time communication protocol
- **MongoDB**: NoSQL database for data storage
- **Nodemailer**: Email sending library for Node.js
- **React**: Frontend library for building user interfaces

## Prerequisites
- Node.js (v12.x or higher)
- MongoDB (v4.x or higher)
- npm (Node package manager)

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/repo-name.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd repo-name
   ```
3. Install the dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
4. Set up environment variables by creating a `.env` file in the root directory:
   ```env
   PORT=3000
   MONGODB_URI=your_mongodb_uri
   JWT_SECRET=your_jwt_secret
   SMTP_HOST=your_smtp_host
   SMTP_PORT=your_smtp_port
   SMTP_USER=your_smtp_user
   SMTP_PASS=your_smtp_password
   ```

## Usage
1. Start the backend server:
   ```bash
   npm run server
   ```
2. Start the frontend development server:
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```
3. Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:3000`.
